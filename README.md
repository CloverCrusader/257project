Users can 
1) Sort the colleges by acceptence rate, graduation rate, and tuition
2) Compare the stats of two different schools
3) Estimate their financial aid based on their household income (using data reported from previous students)
4) Discover which colleges' most popular major aligns with their major interest
5) Hover over a map of the United States to see the general location of the 50 colleges

Our data covers the top 50 US colleges as of 2024, however the data itself is only up to date as of 2021.
